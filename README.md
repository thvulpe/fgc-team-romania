## 🤖 About the Robot

Our robot was designed to collect and store perforated black balls representing CO₂ molecules in the game "Carbon Capture". We used the FTC SDK platform and implemented mechanisms for efficient ball collection, transportation, and storage, along with strategies to gain bonus points by parking the robot on designated platforms at the end of the match.
